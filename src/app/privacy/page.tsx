                            Moving Walls Pte Ltd is a global media solutions provider with a suite of ad tech products. We partner with DOOH site owners, third-party mobile website publishers, and mobile app developers to serve ads on their sites and in their apps, and Moving Walls Pte Ltd may also serve ads on the site and mobile applications that Moving Walls Pte Ltd owns.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            These ads may be customised to their users&apos; interests and geographic locations, which we may derive or infer from information that we collect about how those users interact with such sites and apps (this type of advertising is often called &quot;interest-based advertising&quot; or &quot;targeted advertising&quot;). This enables our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to their users, often using the advertising revenues they generate to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Further, we may also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and/or advertisers&apos; partners for optimising digital advertising and/or analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and reporting. Please note that collection, use or storage of such data is governed by the privacy policy of such third-party partners and/or advertisers providing the same.
